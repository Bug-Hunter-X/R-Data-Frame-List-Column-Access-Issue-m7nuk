# R Data Frame List Column Access Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with lists within columns of R data frames.  The problem arises from R's expectation of homogeneous data types within a column.  Using nested lists within data frames can lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors when trying to access elements.

The `bug.R` file contains code that reproduces the error. The `bugSolution.R` file provides a corrected approach that uses a more suitable data structure for managing nested data or flattens the nested list to improve data consistency.  This project emphasizes the importance of careful data structuring in R to avoid potential issues.
